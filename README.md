# PyTacToe
>A simple CLI multiplayer tictactoe game made in Python.

## How to run?
You probably already know, simply run the script in a shell. You can also use `import pytactoe` in a Python session.

## What is this game?
In case you didn't understand, it's that famous silly little game you used to play with your deskmate when you were desperately bored at school. Yes, the one with crosses and circles

## How does it work?

There are four ways to win in tictactoe:
### Horizontal tris
When you manage to do this tris, it means you placed 3 marks in a given line. So 3 x coordinates in a given y coordinate. That  also means the lenght of a given sub-list equals 3.

```python
           return winner
       ...
```

### Vertical tris

```python
       ...
           return winner
       ...
```

### Top-left to bottom-right diagonal tris
When this occurs, it means that 3 coordinates couples have the same value(1-1, 2-2, 3-3)

```python
```

### Top-right to bottom-left diagonal tris
Finally, this tris means that the sum between a given coordinates couple equals 4 for 3 times

```python
       ...
               return winner
       ...
```
